I am currently located in Boston, MA and attending Northeastern University.
I am completing a Bachelors in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

While in classes, I work at the ResNet Resource Center.
Originally the job description entailed fixing other students computers.
I became lead developer, and for the past few years I've been working on in house Django projects.

Northeastern requires experiential learning to graduate and consequently is a 5 year school with a strange schedule.
For 6 months, from July to January, I work full time at a company in my field and put classes on hold.
Summer and Fall of 2012, I was at [QinetiQ-NA Techonology Solutions Group Unmanned Systems](https://www.qinetiq-na.com/products/unmanned-systems/) as a Robotics Software Engineering Coop.
Summer and Fall of 2013, I was at [Swipely, Inc.](http://www.swipely.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern.

At QinetiQ, I worked on a scalable autonomous robotic kernel written in C++.
Using LIDARs and GPS, we were able to map rooms and plot paths the robot could use to drive from point A to point B avoiding all possible obstacles.
I also worked on a small PICMicrocontroller part that would read from I2C and connect and charge or discharge lead acid batteries.

At Swipely, I worked on a large Ruby on Rails codebase that facilitates our merchants in understanding their credit card sales.
In addition, I worked a DevOps role, writing Ruby gems to package applications in a Linux container leveraging Docker and pushing the package to Amazon Web Services to be deployed to their network.

In my free time, I am tinkering with languages like Ruby, Python, Haskell, and JS and I've worked with Lisp, Racket, Cocoa, C, C++ and PHP in the past.
I've become increasingly interested in big data applications and graphing the movement of data on the internet.

I spent a weekend throwing together [HN History](http://www.hn-history.com/), a simple application to track the HackerNews front page over time (every 5 minutes).

I'm always looking for interesting hardware and software hacks to spend a weekend pulling together.
Lately, I've been comparing Google's AngularJS and Facebook's React for a frontend view layer.
I've grown accustomed to using Sinatra and Grape as a backend JSON endpoint API.
While working at ResNet, I work with the Django Framework, leveraging Celery for task queueing.

Feel free to look at my contributions to various open source projects.
